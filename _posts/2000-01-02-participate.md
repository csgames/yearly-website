To participate, you need to buy a ticket for each team member.

A team is composed of 7 to 10 participants. They can be accompanied by a godfather to coach them, the godfather in question can be a chaperone from the faculty (professor, club advisor, etc.) as well as a former student. Note that the godfather cannot participate in any competition block with the exception of Puzzle Hero.

Please note that we restrain to one team per school at early bird stage. We will contact you for second teams after the early bird sale.
